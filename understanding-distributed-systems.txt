Key Characteristics of Distributed System
	1. Scalability:
			a. Horizontal vs Vertical scaling : 
				. Horizontal is adding more servers and vertical is increasing the computing power
				. MongoDB and Cassandra are good examples of horizontal scaling and Mysql is a good example of vertical scaling
				. Vertical scaling involves downtime as me need to move from smaller machines to bigger machines
				
	2. Reliability:
			a. The ability of a system to work if one or more component of the Sytem fails
			b. Need to replace the broken component/subsystem with a new one
			c. Redundancy of software/component/data is required though it comes with an extra cost
	
	3. Availability: 
			a. A reliable system is available but the vice versa is not true i.e. an available system may not be reliable
			b. Increased reliablity will increase Availability the other way doesn't hold good
	
	4. Efficiency:
			a. It can be measured by 2 properties:
				. Latency: The time taken to get a result
				. Throughput: The number of results fetched in a given time
	
	5. Serviceability and Manageability

Load Balancing:
	1. It help you scale Horizontally and does Health checks on each nodes and stop redirecting if any fails
	2. Different algorithms:
			a. Least Connection Method
			b. Least Response Time Method
			c. Least Bandwidth Method
			d. Round Robin Method
			e. Weighted Round Robin method
			f. IP Hash
	3. We can have multiple Loadbalancer a cluster and the load balancers check eachother's health and kickin when required
